<h1>Introduction to Howler</h1>
<p>Based on the Problem-Solution-Insight premise of evaluating (and therefore pitching) a startup described by Alex Hale at YCombinator's startup school session on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOtCl5PU8F0&amp;t=86s"><em>How To Evaluate Startup Ideas</em></a>. I have screenshotted the main slides over at REFERENCE StartingUp.pdf.
So, Howler is (or at least should be) a specific solution to a very basic set of problems.</p>
<p>I believe that it IS a solution the problem of <a href="/2021/06/09/gunship2021/">irrelevant typing</a>.</p>
<h2>Problem: Typing Slow, Reading Hard for Asynchronous Communication</h2>
<p>The emergence of the smartphone has led to an explosion in asynchronous communication, mostly in the form of text. The increased reading and typing rely tremendously on vision, a computationally and cognitively expensive tasks. And, worse, today we are using it in many places where it would be faster to use a different medium: sound.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the emergence of video calling has also made synchronous communication visually intensive, but it night still be less common to use that than just voice calls. But, somehow, there is a greater stress on using video for professional interactions than for personal interactions.</p>
<p>In summary, there are two problems:
1. <strong>Creation problem</strong>: Typing on a smartphone keyboard has become pervasively painful 
2. <strong>Consumption</strong>:  Vision is more data-dense and intensive than hearing. </p>
<h2>Solution: Speaking Fast, Listening Easy for Asynchronous Communication</h2>
<h2>Insight: Take best features of e-mail and marry it with the east of SMS</h2>
<h1>Conclusion: What is HOWLER?</h1>
<ul>
<li>HOWLER is a predominantly voice-based instant messenger that is faster than e-mail and easier than texting. Howler is a platform that makes instant messaging luxurious messaging.</li>
<li>Howler is a shareable audio platform intended for private messaging that you can then publish to a social platform as an asynchronously developed</li>
</ul>
<h2>HOWLER makes voice notes more effective than email and text messaging, in one go.</h2>
